            <p class="text"> Homer Jay Simpson is a fictional character and one of the main protagonists of the American
                animated
                sitcom The Simpsons. He is voiced by Dan Castellaneta and first appeared on television, along with the
                rest of his family, in The Tracey Ullman Show short "Good Night" on April 19, 1987. Homer was created
                and designed by cartoonist Matt Groening while he was waiting in the lobby of James L. Brooks' office.
                Groening had been called to pitch a series of shorts based on his comic strip Life in Hell but instead
                decided to create a new set of characters. He named the character after his father, Homer Groening.
                After appearing for three seasons on The Tracey Ullman Show, the Simpson family got their own series on
                Fox, which debuted December 17, 1989.
